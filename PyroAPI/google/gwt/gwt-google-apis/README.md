This project is no longer actively developed or maintained.  

This project collects the various JavaScript API bindings for GWT. Each 
supported API lives in its own sub-directory and will produce an isolated 
distribution image. 

If you want to build all of the APIs then you can use the build.xml ant script 
in this directory. If you want to build a specific API then you should use the 
build.xml file in the API directory that you are interested in.
