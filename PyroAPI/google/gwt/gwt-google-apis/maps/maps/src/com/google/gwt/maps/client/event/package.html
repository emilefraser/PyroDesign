Event handling classes used in the Google Maps API Library for GWT

<p>
This package contains classes that provide bindings to the GEvent style events from
the Maps API.  Each event has a specific Handler class and Event class.  The parameters
to events are encapsulated inside the Event classes so that future changes to the
Maps JS API can be handled without having to change user code written against earlier
versions of the gwt-maps APIs.
